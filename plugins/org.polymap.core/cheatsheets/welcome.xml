         Although we try very hard to keep the english translation as complete as possible currently the &apos;native&apos; language of the Workbench is german.
<br/><br/>
If you want to see a better english translation or another language to be supported by POLYMAP3 then please volunteer to help with this or any other part of the development. Thanks.
