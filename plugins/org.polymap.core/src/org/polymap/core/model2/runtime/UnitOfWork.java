/**
 * A UnitOfWork helps to track entity modifications. A {@link UnitOfWork} should be
 * used to logically group operations that modify a set of entities. These
 * modifications can then be written down to the underlying store in one atomic
 * transaction.
 * <p/>
 * The UnitOfWork does not provide a notion of 'rolling back' aka rollback(). Before
 * {@link #prepare()}/{@link #commit()} all modifications are local to the
 * UnitOfWork. After {@link #commit()} all modifications are persitently stored. By
 * calling {@link #close()} the UnitOfWork can be *discarded* at any point in time.
 * There is no way to revert or 'taking back' modifications.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations should be thread-safe. In order to achieve this
 * {@link UnitOfWorkImpl} provides basic functions to track loaded entities.
