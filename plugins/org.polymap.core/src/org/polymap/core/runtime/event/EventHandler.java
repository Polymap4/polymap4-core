/**
 * Annotates methods that handle events published via {@link EventManager}.
 * <p/>
 * The method is executed inside the dispatcher thread of the {@link EventManager}.
 * It should return quickly. For long running task a {@link UIJob} should be created.
 * By specifying a {@link #delay()} the method is executed inside a new Job
 * automatically.
 * 
 * @param scope ({@link Event.Scope#Session}) One of the {@link Event.Scope}
 *        constants. Defaults to {@link Event.Scope#Session}.
 * @param display (false) True specifies that the handler is to be executed inside
 *        the {@link Display} thread. Defaults to false.
 * @param delay (0) Specifies that the execution of this handler is to be delayed by
 *        the given amount of milliseconds. Delayed handler have to have a {@link List} of
 *        events as parameter. This list contains all the events that have been
 *        catched in the delay time. Delayed handlers are always executed inside a
 *        {@link Job} (if not marked as {@link #display()}). Defaults to 0 (no delay).
