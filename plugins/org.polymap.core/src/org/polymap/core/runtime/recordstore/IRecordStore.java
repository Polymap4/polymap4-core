/**
 * Provides the API (and SPI) of a record store.
 * <p/>
 * The basic idea of record store system is to provide a <b>schema-less</b> store for
 * structured data which exposes a <b>simple</b>, <b>JSON-like</b> API. Neither
 * (domain) modelling nor entity/session support is provided. The record store is
 * meant as a easy to use API (and easy to implement SPI) to build backends for
 * higher level data/domain modelling solutions, such as OGC GeoAPI and Qi4J.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Lucene</b> is used as the backend store. While it should be as easy as possible
 * to use other backend solutions as well.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Records</b> are represented by {@link IRecordState}. This interface provides a
 * schema-less, JSON-like API to access the data in the store. Updates are done via
 * an {@link Updater} which provides a 2-phase commit protocol. There is support for
 * external transaction monitors currently.
